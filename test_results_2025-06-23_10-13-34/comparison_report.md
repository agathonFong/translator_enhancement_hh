> Subject: Urgent Update on Order #P-5821 - Material Change. Hi Team, Please be advised that the client has requested a change to the material specifications for their upcoming order of color boxes. The main structure must now be made from 2mm thick `greyboard` for added rigidity, not the standard `paperboard` we quoted. For the exterior, we will be `laminating` 157 `gsm coated paper` onto the surface. The final product requires individual `shrink wrap` for protection during shipping. Please update the bill of materials and confirm the new cost immediately. Thanks.
